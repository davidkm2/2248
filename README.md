# 2248
My project for Programming Environment and Programming Technologies classes.
I chose the game named 2248, because I found it interesting and challenging.

## How to play
The game is a 4x4 table. Each cell has its values.
You have to score more points.
Click the number up, down, left, right, diagonal in any of the eight directions
Search and click on two same numbers as a start.
The next connect number can be the same or can be multiplied by 2.
If you are done clicking, press ENTER to merge them.
The result is a multiple of 2 for all connected numbers sum.
The score is the sum of all connected numbers.

## Install
 1. `mvn clean install` on the main project
 2. `mvn exec:java` to run the game
